%% Lab 1
% The subject of study for this lab is Bayesian decision theory.
%%
% The training set being used is the iris training set.

%% Part 1

%% Question 1: 
% Using a singal discriminant function $g(x_2)$, design a 2 class
% minimum-error-rate classifier (dichtomizer) from the given data, to
% classift *IRIS* samples into to either _Iris Setosa_ or _Iris 
% Versicolor_, according to the feature: _Sepal Width_.

%% Question 2:
% Using the shell program _lab1.m_, write a program that will take
% individual sample values as the input and will return the _posteriror
% probabilities_ and the values of $g(x_2)$.

%% Question 3:
% Identify the class labels for the feature values using your program, and
% indicat their respective posterior probabilities and discriminant values:
% $x_2 = [3.3, 4.4, 5.0, 5.7, 6.3]$.

%% Question 4:
% Arrive at a optimal threshold ($T_{h1}$) that seperates classes $\omega_1$
% and $\omega_2$ (theoretically or experimentally). Justify your results.

%% Question 5:
% Suggest how $T_{h1}$ would be affected if a higher penalty is associated
% with classifying class $\omega_2$ as a class $\omega_1$ - show with
% epxeriment.

%% Question 6:
% Adjust your program to accept _Sepal Length_ as the discriminating
% feature $g(x_1)$. Suggest which of the two features ($x_1$, $x_2$) might
% be a better choice for sperating the two classes $\omega_1$ and
% $\omega_2$. Jutify.
