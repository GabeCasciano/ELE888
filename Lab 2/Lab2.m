% The subject of study for this lab is Linear Discrimnant functions.
%%
% The training set being used is the iris training set.<

%% Question 1
% Construct a new data set from *A* and *B* by setting aside 30% of the
% sample from those original sets (this will be used for _training
% purposes_). Construct a second set from the remaining 70% of data (this
% will be used for _testing_). Use the 30% set (training set) to compute
% the weight vector $\eta(k) = \eta(\bullet) = 0.01, \Theta = 0,$ and an
% initial values of $a(0) = [001]$. Limit your maximum iterations to 300
% (i.e even if you can not achieve $\theta=0$).


%% Questions 2
% Use the 70% set (test samples) and the weight vector computer in the
% previous step to calculate the classification accuracy of the classifier.

%% Question 3
% Repeat the above steps by changing the data split to 70% (training) and
% 30% (testing).

%% Question 4
% Repeat all the above for test and training sets constructed from the
% combination of data set *B* and *C* (i.e _Iris Versicolor_ vs, _Iris
% Virginica_)

%% Question 5
% Compute the weight vextors and stuct the gradient descent algorithms for
% two different values of $\eta(k)$, and the initial values of *a*.

%% Question 6
